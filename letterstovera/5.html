<p><span class="bir">Katyusha,
After</span><span class="iki"> finishing the letter to you, I went out to post it,</span><span class="bir"> stopped in at the clock shop (turns out that they</span><span class="iki"> still can’t tell me how much the repairs will cost!), then</span><span class="bir"> bought a razor, then acquired a stamp collection for two marks – ten</span><span class="iki"> tens and five twenties – and on top of that,</span><span class="bir"> from a stand, two English books for fifty [pfennigs]: Squire, Steps to</span><span class="iki"> Parnassus (literary parodies) and the renowned Henry James, The Outcry (a novel).</span><span class="bir"> I returned home (the weather, meanwhile, has turned warmer, and I’m wearing the new trousers) and had</span><span class="iki"> lunch (meat stew and apple spittle). After lunch I began to read through my</span><span class="bir"> lecture – and here, Sofa called, to say E. I. had arrived. On the way to the Kaplans’</span><span class="iki"> I stopped by at Regensburg, saw there E. I. and E. L., who got back yesterday.</span><span class="bir"> I haven’t learned especially much about you from E. I. She is unusually unforthcoming.</span><span class="iki"> I learned in any case that you’ve moved to Todtmoos – which I very much welcome.</span><span class="bir"> Your fur-coat is being sent to you all the same. Then I was at K.’s for his lesson,</span><span class="iki"> quietly came home, thinking I’d find a little letter from you and of course was mistaken.</span><span class="bir"> I think I’ll also stop writing to you. Before dinner I read the books I’d bought, had dinner</span><span class="iki"> (macaroni and cold-cuts) and, around nine, sailed off to the Tatarinovs. Gradually, a great multitude</span><span class="bir"> of people gathered there (of course, Aykhenvald, Volkovysky, Kadish, Ofrosimov, and so on),</span><span class="iki"> and I began. I spoke (I did not read, only peeked in from time to time – when quoting)</span><span class="bir"> for more than an hour. They found the lecture brilliant but very vicious and somewhat ‘fascistic’.</span><span class="iki"> Volkovysky especially attacked me. It all finished about one. I saw Mme Falkovsky to the corner of Augsburg[er] Strasse</span><span class="bir"> and quietly returned to my solitary little room. It’s now a quarter to two, tomorrow is Sunday, I’ll sleep in.</span><span class="iki"> I’m sending you the lecture – of course I changed and added an awful lot when</span><span class="bir"> I was speaking – this is only a summary. There you are. Beddy-time, Katyusha. I more than adore you.</span><span class="iki">You are my happiness and life. When I   think about you,</span><span class="bir"> I get so happy and light, and since I think about you always, I’m always happy and light.</span><span class="iki"> And tonight, someone will be writing a little short story – or rather composing it till sleep comes.</span><span class="bir"> My joy, Katyushen’ka, my little music, my love.</span><span class="iki"> Todtmoos is cosy, isn’t it? We stayed at</span><span class="bir"> the Adler inn there. Good night, Katyushen’ka.</span>
