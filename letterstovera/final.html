	   <p id="1ci" style="display: none;"> Katyusha,<br>
        After finishing the letter to you, I went out to post it, stopped in at the clock shop (turns out that they still can’t tell me how much the repairs will cost!), then bought a razor, then acquired a stamp collection for two marks – ten tens and five twenties – and on top of that, from a stand, two English books for fifty [pfennigs]: Squire, Steps to Parnassus (literary parodies) and the renowned Henry James, The Outcry (a novel). I returned home (the weather, meanwhile, has turned warmer, and I’m wearing the new trousers) and had lunch (meat stew and apple spittle). After lunch I began to read through my lecture – and here, Sofa called, to say E. I. had arrived. On the way to the Kaplans’ I stopped by at Regensburg, saw there E. I. and E. L., who got back yesterday. I haven’t learned especially much about you from E. It’s now a quarter to two, tomorrow is Sunday, I’ll sleep in. I’m sending you the lecture – of course I changed and added an awful lot when I was speaking – this is only a summary. There you are. Beddy-time, Katyusha. I more than adore you. You are my happiness and life. When I   think about you, I get so happy and light, and since I think about you always, I’m always happy and light. And tonight, someone will be writing a little short story – or rather composing it till sleep comes. My joy, Katyushen’ka, my little music, my love. Todtmoos is cosy, isn’t it? We stayed at the Adler inn there. Good night, Katyushen’ka.</p>

        <p id="2ci" style="display: none;"> My sweet,
        I dreamt that I was walking along the Palace Embankment with someone, the water in the Neva is lead-coloured, flowing thickly, and there are masts, masts without end, large boats and small ones, colourful stripes on black pipes – and I say to my companion: ‘The Bolsheviks have such a big fleet!’ And he replies: ‘Yes, that’s why they had to remove the bridges.’ After that we walked around the Winter Palace, and for some reason it was purple all over – and I thought that I must note this down for a short story. We stepped out onto the Palace Square – it was squeezed from all sides by buildings, some kind of fantastic lights were playing. And my entire dream was lit up by some threatening light – the kind you find in battle paintings.
        Here, my sweet, is what the sixteenth day of my grass widowhood was like. Neither sight nor sound of you. Why do you write so seldom, my sweet? I regret terribly not arranging for you the same kind of note-pad you arranged for me – with dates. It is five minutes to nine now. Two plumpish coffee-coloured dachshunds are frolicking below in the yard– from above, it looks like two pawless sausages rolling about. My sweet, I don’t know where you are now (where you’ll be reading this letter). I love you. My sweet, I love you. Do you hear?
        </p>

          My love, my darling, the last days in Paris were dedicated mostly to arranging my French evening. Ergaz (who has filled out a little and divorced her husband) took to this very actively and introduced me to the lady (S. Ridel) at whose home it will all take place (the little hall has room for 80). And there are also great hopes of finding a French publisher for ‘Despair’. I asked Supervielle to introduce my reading, but he said no, citing his workload and his shyness. They are now looking for another Frenchman (maybe Marcel). I was also at Roche’s. 
          I think that my little darling is already sleeping. I love you. Tomorrow (18th) I return to Paris and right after the evening there, to Berlin. I received an offer to come back at Easter to give a lecture here about Russian literature, with my trip paid for first class. I do not doubt that either in Paris or here Grishen’ka and his family could settle down, but one has to decide on the move. I love you very much. The little puppy has grown up a bit, chews everything, adorable. What would I have done without my wonderful brunette – the black suit. But I could have left the blue jacket behind. I love you madly and miss you madly.

          My love, my angel, congratulations: 14 years! One more week, and I will kiss you, my tenderness. Today, when I got up, I suddenly felt like dropping everything and coming back – especially since Gleb tells me sourly that the English evening at Mme Shklovsky’s won’t give me more than 3 pounds (however, I’ll take my own measures too). I’ll pay her a visit tomorrow to arrange everything with her in person. So, now: I have just sent a letter to Konovalov, at P. O. Euston, London (figuring that if he passes through there – though he does not know I’m here till the 21st – I’ll see him again). I think he’s still in Paris, at his father’s. 
          Well, that’s how things are, my darling. Everything that I do I do as if in the dark, gropingly, since I feel myself a cretin in cunning human connections. I’m ready to come back to Paris, having left the Leeds castle hanging in the lilac dusk an inch above the horizon, but if this happens, believe it, it won’t be my fault – I’m doing all in my powers and possibilities. It seems the most important thing for me now is to get my papers to them and then to appear there in person. Struve is even more unreliable than Klamm’s messenger.
          Yellow-blue bus, I love you. I adore you.
