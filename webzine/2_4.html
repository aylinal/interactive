<h2> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8 nov 1925</h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how can i explain to you, my happiness, my golden,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wonderful happiness, how much i am all yours – with all my memories,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; poems, outbursts, inner whirlwinds? or explain that i cannot <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; write a word without hearing how you will pronounce it – and can’t <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; recall a single trifle i’ve lived through without regret – so sharp! – that we haven’t lived <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;through it together – whether it’s the most, the most personal, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; intransmissible – or only some sunset or other at the bend of a road – you see <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; what i mean, my happiness?
and i know: i can’t tell you anything in words – and when i<br> do on the phone then it comes out completely wrong. because with you one needs to talk <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;wonderfully, the way we talk with people long gone, do you know what i mean,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; in terms of purity and lightness and spiritual precision – but i – je patauge terribly. yet <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; you can be bruised by an ugly diminutive – because you are so absolutely <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resonant – like seawater, my lovely.<br>
i swear – and the inkblot has nothing to do with it – i swear by all that’s dear to me,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all i believe in – i swear that i have never loved before as i radiance. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; on this page, my love, i once  began to write a poem for you and this <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;very inconvenient little tail got left – i’ve lost my footing. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; but there’s no other paper. and most of all i want you to be happy and it seems <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;to me that i could give you that happiness – a sunny, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;simple happiness – and not an altogether common one.
and you should<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; forgive me for my pettiness – that i am thinking with aversion about <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;how – practically – i will mail this letter tomorrow – and yet i am ready <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to give you all of my blood, if i had to – it’s hard to explain – sounds flat – but that’s how it is.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; here, i’ll tell you – with my love i could have filled ten centuries of fire, songs, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and valour – ten whole centuries, enormous and winged, – full of knights riding<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; up blazing hills – and legends about giants – and fierce troys – and orange <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; sails – and pirates – and poets. and this is not literature since if <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; you reread carefully you will see that the knights have turned out to be fat.<br>
no – i simply want to tell you that somehow i can’t imagine life <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;without you in spite of your thinking that it is ‘fun’ for me not to see you for <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; two days. and you know, it turns out that it wasn’t edison at all who thought up the telephone <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;but some other american, a quiet little man whose name no one remembers.<br> it serves him right.<br>
listen, my happiness – you won’t say again that i’m <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;torturing you? how i’d like to take you off somewhere with me – you know<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  how those highwaymen of old did: a wide-brimmed hat, a black mask, and a bell-shaped musket. i love you,<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; i want you, i need you unbearably … your eyes – which shine so wonder-struck <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;when, with your head thrown back, you tell something funny – your eyes, your voice, lips, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; your shoulders – so light, sunny …<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
you came into my life – not as one comes to visit but as one comes<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to a kingdom where all the rivers have been waiting for your <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;reflection, all the roads, for your steps. fate wanted to <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; correct its mistake – as if it has asked my forgiveness <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for all of its previous deceptions. so how can i leave you, my fairy-tale, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;my sun? you see, if i’d loved you less, <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; then i would have had to go. but this way – it makes no sense. and <br>i don’t want to die, either. there are two kinds of ‘come what may’. involuntary <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;and deliberate. forgive me – but i live by the second one.</p>
